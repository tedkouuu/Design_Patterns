It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated / We will abstract everything out:
  1.The method that orders the object
  2.The factories that build the object
  3.The final objects

 - The Abstract Factory allows you to create families of related objects without
   specifying a concrete class

 - Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed
   dynamically during runtime

 - You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects
   interact through common interfaces
