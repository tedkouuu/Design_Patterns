  The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its
    representation so that the same construction process can create different
    representations.

    The Builder pattern can be applied when construction of various representations
    of the product involves similar steps that differ only in the details.

    The base builder interface defines all possible construction steps,
    and concrete builders implement these steps to construct particular representations of the product.
    Meanwhile, the director class guides the order of construction.
