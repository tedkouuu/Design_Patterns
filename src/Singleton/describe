     The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance
     and provides a global point of access to that instance.
     It is named after the singleton set, which is defined to be a set containing one element

     or Singleton is like a single resource which is being shared among multiple users.

     *******
     Spring  example:

     Singleton is the default scope for a Bean, the one that will be used if nothing else is indicated.
     This scope implies that Spring container will create an only shared instance of the class designated by this bean,
     so each time the Bean is required the same object will be injected.
